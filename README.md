Generates DAG graphs and drawings if you ask very nicely :)

Installation 

Follow these instructions

https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/install.html

Installing networkx is only necessary if you want your graphs drawn. If you don't want them drawn, just run generatorNoDrawings.

You know how to execute a python file from your commandprompt.

Will create .in files, and images, in the directory the python file is located equal to the amount of test cases you request.

.in files will contain the following
1 line with two integers. First one is the number of vertices and the 2nd one is the number of edges.
Edges number of lines with 3 integers. First integer is the start of a directed edge, second integer is the end of the directed edge and the third is the weight.
