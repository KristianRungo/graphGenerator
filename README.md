# graphGenerator
Generates DAG graphs and drawings if you ask very nicely :)

Installation 

Follow these instructions

https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/install.html

Installing networkx is only necessary if you want your graphs drawn. If you don't want them drawn, just run generatorNoDrawings.

You know how to execute a python file from your commandprompt.

Will create .in files, and images, in the directory the python file is located equal to the amount of test cases you request.
